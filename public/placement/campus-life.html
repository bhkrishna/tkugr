                  <p>National Service Scheme is an MHRD, Government of India, initiative for the under graduate students of India to link education to community service. As indicated by the motto of NSS which states “Not me, but you,” students are encouraged to actively involve themselves in programs that spread awareness of key concepts like environment, health, hygiene, sanitation, patriotism, service etc. among the people. Students participating in such activities invariably develop stronger and more stable personalities that are tempered by their experience with community service and spreading awareness. RGUKT, Basar, has a very active NSS wing with about 1000 volunteers. The NSS wing at RGUKT, Basar has now extended to rope in the XI and XII class students into this laudable scheme.</p>

                  <p>Visaka - Vittiya Saksharata Abhiyaan- stands for transforming India towards cashless transactions and a digital economy. It is a campaign by Higher Educational Institutions for digital economy. Under this program, cashless modes of payment like RuPay, USSD, Debit cards, Mobile Wallets, Net Banking, BHIM etc. are focused on and actively canvassed as preferred modes of payment in comparison to cash payments widely prevalent now.</p>
                  <p>A special awareness program was conducted at RGUKT, Basar on January 4th, 2017. The concept of digital economy and how the University can play a role in the same was highlighted by the Vice Chancellor. As suggested by the campaign Visaka, the aim was to transform the campus into a cashless one with all wages, salaries, vendor purchases and fees for services made cashless. </p>
                  <p>As a first step, RGUKT, Basar, has successfully made all fee payments totally digital – i.e. online. Payments for all fees and salary/wage disbursement have been made digital using programs and procedures. That  are entirely developed in-house.</p>
                  <p>As a second step, RGUKT is planning to encourage students and student social organizations like NSS to take up social awareness camps. Under this plan, student and other volunteers from the University will be actively canvassing with shop owners, small vendors, employees and even householders and highlighting the benefits of cashless transactions and digital economy. </p>
                  <p>Some volunteers will also be registering with MHRD as active participants in this movement.</p>
