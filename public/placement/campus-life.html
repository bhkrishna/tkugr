In this, 200 Digital Leaders were selected for Digital Basar project.</p>

                  <p>Under the Harita Haram programme, RGUKT has taken active part in the government’s initiative to drastically enhance the green cover of planet earth. During the campaign, RGUKT students, faculty and staff planted over 30000 saplings in the past 3 years. Despite scarcity of water being common in the region almost 95% of the saplings were nurtured and have started to grow.  RGUKT plans to undertake this program on a regular basis and keep the idea of green cover for planet earth active.</p>
