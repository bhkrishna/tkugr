			<p><strong>RGUKT</strong> (Rajiv Gandhi University of Knowledge Technologies, <a href="https://www.rgukt.ac.in">www.rgukt.ac.in</a>) has seven branches of engineering – Electrical, Electronics and Communications, Computer Sciences, Mechanical, Civil, Chemical and Metallurgical and Materials Engineering and PG programs in 3 Engineering streams. The students are highly trained and disciplined. As per the University's charter, 85% of the students are taken from the rural districts of Telangana. Several leading companies visit RGUKT every year to recruit our students.</p>

<p>The University runs specialized labs and programs to ensure the students are as industry-ready as possible. <strong>INTEL</strong> Intelligent lab in the domain of sensors and Internet of Things set up by <strong>Intel</strong>, <strong>IBM’s CEP</strong> (Career Education Program) in cloud computing, <strong>ARM</strong> University program in Embedded systems are some of the specialized labs and courses that are currently operating in the campus.</p>

<p><strong>NASSCOM’s</strong> QP (Qualification Pack) and <strong>FSIT</strong> programs in Data Analytics, Production Design and Heavy equipment are scheduled to commence this academic year as RGUKT has already signed an MoU. RGUKT has signed an MoU with the Non-Ferrous Materials Technology Development Centre (<strong>NFTDC</strong>) and <strong>C-DAC</strong> where our students do a full semester internship in ongoing funded research projects. <strong>KIHT</strong> (Kalam Institute of Health Technologies) has signed an MoU for incubating and encouraging startups in the domain of health technologies, medical devices and community health domains.</p>

<p>RGUKT also houses the <strong>TIIC</strong> (Telangana Innovation and Incubation Centre) in its campus which it hosts under an MoU with <strong>TITA</strong> (Telangana IT Association). In the first phase TIIC is being developed to host about 15 industry startups. Space for a few student’s startups is also being provided. The students are going to be mentored by industry experts who are members of TITA global family.</p>

<p>RGUKT has slowly but surely risen in reputation as its graduating engineers have acted as perfect brand ambassadors for the university. Batches of engineers graduated from RGUKT are placed in various companies, Government services and public sector. The metamorphosis of these students from reticent youngsters unsure of themselves into professionals rubbing shoulders with the best is a matter of great satisfaction and also a testimony to the founding principles of the University. RGUKT believes in inculcating right attitude in the minds of young students and develop them as individuals who have the innate desire not just to succeed in their own lives but also to contribute meaningfully to societal development in all possible spheres.</p>
