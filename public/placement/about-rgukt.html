  				It has been observed that, on an average, the marks obtained by the students in rural India are about 10-20% lower than the marks of students studying in private schools of urban India. As a result, most of the seats for higher education gets filled by students from these private schools when the basis of selection is the marks obtained. Even if a rural student is capable, the educational system doesn't allow him to go ahead. The goal of RGUKT is to help remedy this unfortunate situation.  This is overcome by adding deprivation score of 0.4 to the 10th class GPA applicants from non-residential Government Schools including Zillaparishad and Municipal Schools.

					Having an objective to provide high quality Engineering Education to the rural meritorious youth of Telangana State who are social and economically backward, the University is now a home to 135 faculty members, 120 non - teaching staff and 60 out sourcing staff.
