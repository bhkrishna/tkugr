RGUKT Basar is not just another university where you learn the subject, graduate, and move on but it is an encyclopedia of learning where I have received not only the formal education but also learned the lessons for life. Having joined the university at a very young age of 15 immediately after matriculation it was overwhelming for a typical student who had undergone traditional schooling to sit inside a classroom equipped with modern Information and technology tools in place of a regular classroom and start learning by himself through "Learning by doing". <br>It would have been impossible to cope up to such a steep transition but thanks to the knowledgeable mentors and our techie HRTs who have guided us at every step and played a key role in laying a strong and essential foundation at the Pre-University level. For a strong tree, strong roots are the key. Our basics of education at the PUC level were very strong with the subject depth and the conceptual clarity gained by watching the videos made by the domain experts all across the country. With such a strong foundation I have entered the most cherished part of my life which is the engineering phase at RGUKT. The meticulously planned curriculum, the state of the art laboratory facilities, and the energy of the young faculty combined with the NPTEL lectures from premier institutes of the country played a key role in shaping me into a proficient engineer I especially appreciate the unique examination system at RGUKT which was way ahead of time. <br>The WAT, CAT, and semester examinations are designed in such a pattern that resembles the contemporary competitive exams thus giving us a pre-exposure and making us future-ready. We were the second batch of passing-out students at RGUKT.<br> There are certain difficulties and challenges if yours is one of the first few graduating batches of a new university but I feel that we have grown along with the university. There was an enormous amount of learning from these challenges and they made us resistant to future hardships in the tough world outside. There will be a storm of ideas if a bunch of clever and like-minded students is set to coexist. Classrooms and Hostels are the hotspots of curious and endless discussions, lovely exchange of chit chats, healthy debates, and knowledge fights. Such interactions with friends and fellow students have contributed a lot in ripening my thinking, analytical abilities, and soft skills. The extra-curricular activities like sports, literary, cultural, tech fests, and other social events happening regularly in the college have given me ample opportunities for exploring the other side of me.<br>This definitely has helped me in grooming my personality and all-around development. I strongly believe that such unique features of RGUKT have definitely given me an edge over others in this ever-demanding and highly competitive world. RGUKT Basar is the reason for where I stand now and I could not have chosen better.

The first day I visited our college, memories of the classroom, laptops, dormitory, and new friends are still fresh in my heart. I, as a student never knew, the journey  I am embarking on would be a milestone in building my character, career, and lifetime relationships. Today I appreciate the fact that, within the limited resources, RGUKT has never compromised on its infrastructure in academics, labs, syllabus, and all that is required for an individual to develop.  I am proud of witnessing the huge infrastructural development of RGUKT which has given good exposure to the students.<br> With the constant support and encouragement from the faculty and mentors, I strove for good grades and was also involved in student activities. This built my confidence and helped me in my selection in the Indian Air Force. The cooperative and liberal faculty members always urged the students to think and come up with innovative ideas, techniques on their own to improve academically and also to inculcate communication and leadership skills. <br> The industry inputs, guest lectures, placement cells, business development cells are the major contributions of faculty towards the development of students in every facet.  Campus life was fun amongst greenery with a sports complex, shopping mall, library, and much more.<br>
  Today RGUKT has its own recognition, many companies approach college for placements.   And I proudly state that one can find an RGUKTian in every sector. RGUKT as a family provides a wholesome environment for the development of an individual. I believe “Everyone has hidden talent, the opportunities and experiences and RGUKT will bring them to light

Today, when I look back and reflect on where my professional journey actually started, I feel humbled by the fact that it actually started at RGUKT. It gave me immense opportunities and an ability to express myself without inhibitions. Those experiences instilled confidence in me to step out of my comfort zone, travel the country, learn about new cultures, venture into unknown territories and make a mark for myself!<br>
Throughout my 6 years of pre-university and graduation at RGUKT, I had many opportunities to develop skills, leadership, and proactive thinking through various programs and events. These attributes were the key reasons to succeed in my life. Apart from lecture rooms, the hands-on experience in labs enabled students with industry-level capabilities. It’s been 6 years since I have been working for different industries where knowledge, practical skill set, leadership, and discipline towards profession is an essence. Big thanks to all my faculty members and friends for this amazing journey at RGUKT.

I feel RGUKT is a blessing for talented youth from rural backgrounds. It gives a better platform to develop skills and acquire knowledge. From PUC to B.Tech, every year has its own way of teaching things. Infrastructure is continuously upgrading, either it’s curricular or extra-curricular. The culture at RGUKT is great, the ecosystem pushes the students to become better individuals.<br> Various positions of responsibility and support from teachers helped me to hone skills in leadership &amp; management and led my career to better with MBA in IIM-B. I always cherish the holistic education I got in RGUKT-B.<br> I hope I will see RGUKT alumni in great positions across the sectors in the future and I believe RGUKT is capable of nurturing that type of student.

After completing my SSC in the year 2008, I was confused about my future. Not enough money to go for Higher studies but the goals were high. But God showered blessings on me by giving me a seat in a Prestigious university called RGUKT Basara popularly known as IIIT Basara for 6 years of integrated engineering. As I am the first batch student, I faced difficulties as every 1st batch student of any university will face but those situations made me face any situation in life. <br>Coming to academics, a very perfect structure of academics is designed which allows us to improve our learning skills many fold. Especially the learning by doing sessions, NPTEL Video sessions, and Mentors guidance made learning things very easy. Because of the academic structure and well-designed curriculum, we still remember the things we learned in our college days.<br>
           In my PUC (Pre-University Course) we learned all the subjects (MBPC) without any branch preference which is very different from any other courses of state and central syllabus. Apart from the MBPC course, we have IT classes, also. We used to learn all the computer basics and advanced programming languages like Python in PUC itself. Because of this IT learning, even though many from different branches of engineering are able to write codes and understand software languages easily. The pre-university course curriculum was designed in accordance with engineering basics so it will be easy to continue the subjects in their engineering branches. With a very good score, I have entered into my Engineering course.<br>
  I want to specifically mention the examination pattern of RGUKT. We used to write weekly (WAT), monthly(MAT), and semester examinations in a very unique pattern. Because of that examination pattern, it was easy for us to clear the competitive examination which is in the same format we are following in college. The unique examination system also made us face any challenges and competitions which are time-bound with more accuracy.<br>
As all the students are from poor backgrounds but rich in knowledge, we used to share both things in equal amounts. We help each other either maybe it's financial matters or knowledge. RGUKT is a bunch of talented students. And all the talented students formed into a knowledge hub to this society. We understand the topics not just theoretically but practically by using very good laboratory facilities provided to us. RGUKT allows entrepreneurs to invent the technology, software engineers to develop the technology, civil engineers to build the society, electronics and communication engineers to connect the world. Not only that, there are many engineering students entering all Public sectors, state, and central government offices and doing wonders in their own way. This is not just the greatness of any individual but because of the strong academics of our RGUKT.<br>
        Now I stand as a Public Servant because of RGUKT. Otherwise, I may be in public as one among all the other people. Sincerity, honesty, hard work, and love towards society, all these characteristics develop along with my academic skills in RGUKT. It gives me not just good friends, rich academic skills but also the strength to live life efficiently and face any sort of challenges I'm going to face in my future. I owe to RGUKT.

Dear Reader,
I am Srinivas, alumni of RGUKT-Basar, passed out in2015, I am currently serving as a Design Engineer at Becton Dickinson Technologies Campus India LLP.
I am proud to share that the resources available at RGUKT are highly qualitative and curricula were on par with IITs and NITs. <br>Access to NPTEL resources enables the students to have a chance to listen to the elite faculties in their discipline in India. That gave us a strong foundation to sustain in the competitive world and grow as individuals while contributing to the world.<br>
RGUKT helped me to get campus placement in TCS and GATE rank of 1681 with a score of 735/1000 without any coaching. <br>I joined NIT Warangal for M.Tech in Machine Design and later got campus placement at Stryker Global Technology Center, India.

I entered RGUKT when I had just turned 16. In the very first week I got a glimpse of a wide range of talent on campus and it definitely was quite intimidating initially.<br>

For me, RGUKT has lots of things. It is here that I have grown as a person, scaled new heights, and done things I could never have imagined I could. The plethora of opportunities available for every individual, in the field of their choice is always open.  Be it as Convener of TechFests, Manager of Technical Projects, or a delegate at national and international conferences,  RGUKT has ensured the safety and liberty for me, to explore my potential without inhibitions.

I strongly believe that the university is unique and unconventional in the way it facilitates the learning and growth of thousands of students. It helps students realize and unleash their potential. <br>All you need to have is a spark, innovative ideas, and a strong desire to learn and apply your knowledge to solve real-life problems. The University provides the rest: the faculty who support and mentor you at every stage and the world-class labs and infrastructure required to perform research work and develop prototypes, competitive and inspiring bunch of fellow students. <br>By the end of my journey at the university, I was able to publish in two international journals, intern at IIT and Nuclear Fuel Complex, win in a couple of debating competitions and secure a job. The faculty members act as a constant support in this pursuit of excellence. One could experience the holistic education at the University each and every single day for 6 years. <br>I am grateful for having gotten an opportunity to spend such 6 years there

      RGUKT Basar has played an important role in shaping every student who has graduated from it. I always feel fortunate to have been one among them. Every graduate has a story to tell, an achievement to share, a lesson to share, and a lot more. I would like to talk about two big things that helped me build my career, PROBLEM SOLVING and RESPONSIBILITY. <br>
PROBLEM SOLVING-The efforts that have been put by the administration in building a top-notch engineering infrastructure, well-equipped laboratories, modern information technology sources, and many more that enable the student in visualizing, understanding the engineering problems in a more practical manner and executing the solutions. This practical-oriented approach has helped the students in better understanding the problems in various industries and come up with innovative solutions that built products and companies, which also helped me in co-founding a medical communications company that helps life sciences companies in delivering scientific information in an engaging, digestible and interactive way.<br>
RESPONSIBILITY- The "Learning by Doing" method that every student here talks about taught us to be responsible in gathering resources, learning, making teams, time management, making mistakes, correcting them, and executing the tasks. This eventually has helped us in applying the same in all our jobs right from executing a task to running multi-crore companies. <br>
These are some of the characteristics that students acquire which drove us to operate a tour company with over 50% of the employees from RGUKT Basar.
I strongly feel that adding more research support and industrial support would enable students to achieve more experience within academics and excel in the fields they get into.

      It's still a fresh memory, my first day at the college. I was afraid to be honest, looking at the people, dormitories, and the classrooms. Little did I know that after 6 years, I would be looking at myself working as a scientist at one of India's premier research organizations. <br>
‌ With a unique education system, and resources second to none, RGUKT Basar is the best place for a student to be in. The environment is best suited for students to excel, be it in sports, studies, or any other extracurricular activities. It nurtures the students in every possible way to become a better person besides an engineer. Today, we find the alumni of RGUKT Basar in every field, serving the country for a better future. <br>

M.Karthikreddy (Officer at Hindustan Aeronautics Limited) MME 2010 Batch Way back in 2010 were in my teens from home with the surrounding environment of friends, family, near and dear to an environment which is completely different from my past life by much more developed hi-tech era with the top-end infrastructure and lab facilities, I have stepped into IIIT Basar with many dreams, aims with a lot of passion and for a better future and today I am here proudly saying yes my dream was achieved and my heartfelt thanks to the entire team of IIIT Basar faculty, friends, mentors, etc. Back then there was no idea how I am going to be today when the reminiscences flash through my mind and the entire credit goes to IIIT Basar for shaping me who I am today. <br>My teachers with their advanced teaching skills, the course structure and the video lectures from various platforms in the country from the top professionals with hands-on experience making us learn not just theory but also with the practical experience. It was in my PUC which is not a general thing as a normal intermediate where they have to choose either MPC or BiPC or other groups but I have to take MBiPC, I always thought that I was under tremendous pressure with the curriculum and the mode of examination but now when I think of it I always feel happy that it taught me time management and exposure to basic knowledge where most of the students apart from my university will not have. Back in school days we never had a chance to access the computer but here in college, we were given a laptop individually and we have to study from it though it was a bit quite challenging then it made me take up challenges learn from them achieve them and here I am today. <br>RGUKT Basar is not just about study, marks and ranks or a job other than that the other side of college friends our discussions our knowledge sharing and caring among us taught me brotherhood and also to ask help when needed and give a helping hand to the needful without any second thought this all had shaped me to become a proper citizen with the knowledge given to me by my college. Not just education, the all-round development which college provides by means of the cultural fest, technical fest, and sports activities has brought out the hidden talent in me in the form of a leader, an organizer, and a sportsperson. Teachers play a very important role in shaping the future of their students. Right from kindergarten to university, they are the ones who impart knowledge and teach us about everything important. Moreover, they also teach us about ethical values and imbibe them in our moral values. Thus, we can say that teachers shape our personality into something very strong and wonderful.<br> A world without teachers would definitely be chaotic. There are only a few people in our lives who impact our world, and teachers are definitely one of them. They assume the role of an educator and caregiver for their students. Sometimes, they also become our friends and help us with personal problems, and the faculty of RGUKT were with me right from the beginning in my ups and downs for the integration of my skills. <br><br>I really thank each and everyone for being with me in the due course of time and after my graduation also and I am proud to say I am an RGUKTian forever.

 Established during the Chief Ministership of Late Dr. Y.S Rajashekhar Reddy of United Andhra Pradesh in 2008, the objective of RAJIV GANDHI UNIVERSITY OF KNOWLEDGE TECHNOLOGIES (RGUKT) was to ensure talented rural youth get access to high-quality, technical education as the then existing all India entrance exams were not providing level-playing-field for rural youth who are deprived of facilities their peers enjoy in an urban setup. In March 2008, the Govt. of United Andhra Pradesh created three residential campuses at Basar, Nuzivid and RK Valley to admit top 1% of the rural youth i.e about 6500 graduates. <br>

I, Prasad Mandati, an alumni of RGUKT-Basar, passed out in 2014, was one among those fortunate students to had had an opportunity to pursue the 6-year Integrated B-Tech Programmme at the esteemed RGUKT. I am currently working as an Assistant Section Officer in the Ministry of Education, Central Secretariat Services. 
Hailing from a village where the literary rate never went over even 50%, RGUKT-Basar had come as a boon into my life. My parents who rely on Agriculture for living, didn't have to worry about my career as RGUKT-Basar had taken care of that part. Right from finding a good college for Intermediate education to giving a high quality Engineering Education to giving decent Job to finish off RGUKT-Basar had done it all for me. <br>
The facilities, infrastructure and academic standards we had had at RGUKT-Basar were world-class and well ahead of our time. Be it providing each student a laptop with decent internet connectivity to cater for e-learning right after admission, high-quality AV system with an LCD Projector, a central library, highly equipped mentors, Engineering faculty who were M.Tech Graduates from reputed IITs and NITs, well equipped hostels with very good amenities etc. The list goes on. 
I really feel the basics taught at the PUC level were very strong and conceptual. In fact, it's one of the reasons why I did well in the competitive exams to stand here now. If not with RGUKT-Basar, I surely wouldn't have reached this level. <br>
Lots of love, 
Prasad Mandati 
A proud alumnus of RGUKT Basar

 Hi, I am Praveen. I completed my B.Tech. in ECE from RGUKT during 2008 to 2014. Later, I joined M.Tech. (2014-2016) at IIT Kharagpur to study medical imaging and informatics and subsequently completed my PhD (2017-2020) at HITLab New Zealand in medical image analysis. Currently, I am working as a senior ML scientist at G42 healthcare from 2020. <br>

There is a great saying, “give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime.” Looking at my career trajectory, I have been to different places and met a lot of great people around the world. But, I always consider RGUKT as my starting point, where I learned to “fish”. I was especially benefited by the curriculum and the style of teaching that was adapted at RGUKT, and it still has a profound impact on how I learn things today. I am not going to say there were no challenges at the time, but we all fought through them to make our campus a better place for learning.

I wish all the students to make full use of the campus facilities and have a fun learning experience. I hope you will have as much fun as I had during my time. <br>Thank you.<br>
