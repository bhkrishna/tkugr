The donation of blood and thus, that of life is the greatest of them all. NSS IIIT BASAR  gave the students of IIIT BASAR  a chance to do so themselves by organizing a Blood Donation Camp on 13th September 2015 at IIIT BASAR  Hospital The camp began at 9 AM with inauguration by Prof. Pradipta Banerjee, Director IIIT BASAR. The collection of blood was jointly handled by IMA Blood Bank Dehradun, Himalayan Hospital Blood Bank, and  Civil Hospital. The process designed by these blood banks was very quick and quite simple for donors to follow. Donors had to first fill out the form of the respective blood bank. The hemoglobin level of the donors was checked and blood was collected in allotted wards thereafter. The donors were then allowed to relax for a few minutes and provided with refreshments. A memento and a certificate of donation were also given to the donors as a token of appreciation For many of the donors, this was their first blood donation and it was a very memorable experience for them. “Every suitable person should donate blood, not under coercion of someone but by following their own conscience.” said Dr. Smita Jha, Program Coordinator of NSS IIIT BASAR . The will to donate blood shown by the students was not deterred even in the scorching sun during the afternoon hours. The members of NSS worked hard in organizing this event All the donors had a positive feedback even after waiting in a long queue to donate blood. Many of them took pictures as a memory of this event. The camp eventually concluded at 5 pm and all the donors left with a feeling of happiness and satisfaction As a result of the promotions done and awareness created since a few days ago as well as the resolve of the donors, a new institute record of 1002 units of blood donated was made. The staff of the blood banks congratulated the organizing team as their efforts towards the event were successful...</div>
